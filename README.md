## Task Overview

Your task is to create a user interface for our new feature using React.js as the frontend framework, Tailwind CSS for styling, and integrating Flowbite components for UI elements. The feature should be responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing.

## Requirements

1.  **React.js**: Utilize React.js to build the user interface components. Follow best practices for component structure, state management, and data flow.
    
2.  **Tailwind CSS**: Use Tailwind CSS for styling your components. Tailwind provides a utility-first approach to styling, enabling rapid development and easy maintenance.
    
3.  **Flowbite Components**: Integrate Flowbite components into your project. Flowbite offers a collection of ready-to-use UI components that seamlessly integrate with Tailwind CSS.
    
4.  **Responsive Design**: Ensure that the user interface is responsive and works well across various screen sizes, including desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
    
5.  **Clean Code**: Write clean, well-structured code with meaningful variable names, comments where necessary, and adhere to coding standards.
